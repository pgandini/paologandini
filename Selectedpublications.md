# Selected publications
I am a member of the LHCb Collaboration and in its author list since 2009.
I am regular reviewer for international peer-reviewed journals (e.g APS for Phys. Rev. Lett., Elsevier and other journals).
This list includes only a selection of publications and public documents in which I have been involved as a major/contact contributor.
The complete list of publications can be found on [[INSPIRE]](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20gandini&ui-citation-summary=true).
